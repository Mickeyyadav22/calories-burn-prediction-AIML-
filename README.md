# Calories-Burned-Prediction
Calories-Burned-Prediction Using Machine Learning. (Regression Use case)
Superwised learning model.

The project hosted on GitHub, titled "Calories Burned Prediction," is an AIML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) supervised learning model. Its primary purpose is to predict the number of calories burned by an individual based on user-provided data.

Calorie prediction projects often utilize a variety of machine learning algorithms, depending on the complexity of the data and the desired accuracy.
used algorithms are :

1. **Linear Regression**: Ideal for simple relationships between input features (like weight, duration, and heart rate) and calorie burn.
2. **Decision Trees and Random Forests**: These are versatile and can handle non-linear relationships effectively.
3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Useful for classification tasks and regression problems, especially with smaller datasets.
4. **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting algorithm that excels in predictive accuracy and handles large datasets well.
5. **Neural Networks**: Particularly effective for complex datasets with multiple features, as they can capture intricate patterns.
6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple algorithm that predicts based on the closest data points in the feature space.

Each algorithm has its strengths and is chosen based on the project's requirements, such as computational efficiency, interpretability, or accuracy.
